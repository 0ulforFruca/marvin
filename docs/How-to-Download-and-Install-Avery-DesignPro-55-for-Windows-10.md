## Step 1: Download Avery DesignPro 5.5 from Archive.org
 
The official website of Avery does not offer a download link for Avery DesignPro 5.5 anymore. Instead, they recommend using their online service called Design & Print Online. However, if you prefer to use the offline software, you can still find it on Archive.org[^1^]. Archive.org is a website that preserves digital content and offers free access to millions of books, movies, music, software and more.
 
To download Avery DesignPro 5.5 from Archive.org, follow these steps:

2. Click on the "DOWNLOAD OPTIONS" section on the right side of the page.
3. Click on the "EU\_hu\_DP5\_DL\_20100525.exe" file to download the installer. This is the Hungarian version of the software, but don't worry, we will replace it with the English version later.
4. Click on the "WLRCDLL.DLL" file to download the dll file. This is the file that will make the software work in English.
5. Save both files to your computer.

## Step 2: Install Avery DesignPro 5.5 on Windows 10
 
Once you have downloaded both files from Archive.org, you can install Avery DesignPro 5.5 on Windows 10 by following these steps:

1. Run the EU\_hu\_DP5\_DL\_20100525.exe file to start the installation process.

3. Choose a destination folder for the software. The default location is C:/Program Files (x86)/Avery Dennison/DesignPro 5/.
4. Click on the "BefejezÃ©s" button (which means "Finish") to complete the installation.
5. Navigate to the destination folder where you installed the software.
6. Rename or delete the WLRCDLL.DLL file that is already in the folder.
7. Copy and paste the WLRCDLL.DLL file that you downloaded from Archive.org into the same folder.
